Purpose:
  <br>A quick session to spin up a simple Spring Boot backend in Java.
  
About:
  <br>This project uses a rest controller to return HTTP responses when a user accesses each endpoint:
  
    /hello
    /bye
    
  Serves locally on port 8080. Endpoints can be reached in your browser at the following URLs: 
  
    http://localhost:8080/hello
    http://localhost:8080/bye


  App starts up with the following command:

    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
